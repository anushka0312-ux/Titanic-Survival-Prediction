# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset used is from the famous **Kaggle Titanic** competition.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "Who will survive the Titanic disaster?" using passenger data like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to explore patterns in the data.
- **Modeling:** Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- **Evaluation:** Model accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC curve.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess data and train the model.
3. Evaluate the model performance.
